# ssid-checkin app

to build a mac app:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

then look in `build/releases/SSIDCheckin/mac` for your app

make sure you set your ENV `FSQTOKEN` variable and then run the app in the same folder as your `venues.json` (if you have a better idea on how to configure the app let me know)
